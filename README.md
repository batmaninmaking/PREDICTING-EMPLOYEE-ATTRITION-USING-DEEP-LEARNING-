Project Title 
Predicting Employee Attrition  using a Deep Learning Model
Overview/Description 
Employee attrition creates financial and operational challenges for organizations. In our work we have used traditional statistical methods and deep learning models to predict attrition rate using a dataset of 59,598 employee records with thirty-one features.
Project Structure 
Describe your project directory.
•	Data: We have used two datasets; one is for benchmarking and another model training and validation. Below are the list and purpose of dataset
              WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition---- IBM data set for model benchmarking
              train---- dataset used final model training
              test--- validation dataset
•	Notebooks: We have to total 4 notebooks:

1.	EDA: SummaryEDAProcessingFeature.ipynb
2.	Baseline model development: baselinemodel.ipynb
3.	Model hyperparameter tuning and best model: hyperparemetertuning.ipynb
4.	Validation and result: validation and result.ipynb
